Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::AsForm.

2.1   Thu Jan 29 14:51:31 GMT 2004
    - 2.0 was a rewrite to use HTML::Element
    - This release fixes cases where value => ""
    - And makes "selected" work OK
    - And deals with nulls in has-a relationships, since I managed to
      forget about that again.
    - Make the type detection stuff actually work. Hah.
    - Yes, I know there's something mysql specific in there.
